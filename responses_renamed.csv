When being remote we often believe that there are less noise and communication needed, so we are more effective as a result. It is true if you rarely pull remote days. But if you work remotely full time, it’s quite the opposite – you and your team need to communicate a lot. And then communicate some more. And to be sure everyone has all information needed, you communicate just a bit more. You get to choose, when do you read chats, when do you have calls and so on. It’s no longer noise or disruption that you must deal with immediately. It’s hard and requires practice.
